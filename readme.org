* Vehicle Routing Problem
The violet lines represent integer but not feasible solutions, once a feasible
solution has been found, the paths are distinguished by colors. The light blue
lines fumbling around represent the LP-relaxed problem.

* Bin Packing Problem
Although BPP classifiers can be used/trained independently, the original motive
for this research was to provide a means to calculating the minimum number of
required vehicles for solving a VRP instance. The blue boxes, filling the right
side of the bin, analogously, represent the LP-relaxed problem (which are
cruising out of the bins since they have less constraints :).

* Installation
Cloning the repository:
#+begin_src
  git clone git@github.com:isotlaboratory/ml4vrp.git
#+end_src
Then our fork of [[https://github.com/ds4dm/ecole][École]]:
#+begin_src
  git clone git@github.com:ndrwnaguib/ecole.git
#+end_src
And eventually, SCIP, which is the underlying mathematical solver where we
replace the branching strategies with trained classifiers, [[https://scipopt.org/index.php#download][from here]]. Once the
precomplied version have been extracted, install école using:
#+begin_src
  cd [PATH]/[TO]/ecole
  CMAKE_ARGS="-DSCIP_DIR=[PATH]/[TO]/scipoptsuite/src/build/scip -DCMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH=ON" python -m pip install .
#+end_src

Moreover, the following packages are necessary for the sampling, training, and evaluation steps:

#+begin_src
export SCIPOPTDIR=[PATH]/[TO]/scipoptsuite/usr
python -m pip install pyscipopt
#
python -m pip install pytorch-lightning
python -m pip install fairscale
python -m pip install randomname
#+end_src

** Optimization Problems Instances

The instances used in our experiments for BPP are already included in the
repository given their light size. However, to download the VRP instances,
please run the [[./instances/vrp/download.sh]] bash script.

* Usage Instructions
** Sampling
  To sample B&B decisions when solving a VRP instance, please use the
  following command:
  #+begin_src
    python sample.py --problem "VRP" --instance [VRP_FILE_FORMAT_FILE_PATH] --num-train-samples [DECISION SAMPLES SIZE]
  #+end_src

  For example, to sample a dataset of 1000 decision samples for the [[http://vrp.galgos.inf.puc-rio.br/index.php/en/plotted-instances?data=A-n32-k5][A-n32-k5]]
  instance, the command is:
  #+begin_src
    python sample.py --problem "VRP" --instance datasets/vrp/A/A-n32-k5.vrp --num-train-samples 1000
  #+end_src

  The same command can be used with src_sh[:exports_code]{--problem
  BPP} to do the sample B&B decisions for the BPP; however, along with changing
  the input instance accordingly.

*** Research sampled datasets

  The datasets we sampled and used to train our models are larger in size, we are
  going to share them as soon as we find a suitable dataset repository.

** Training
  #+begin_src
    python train.py --samples-path samples/A-n32-k5 --gpus 1 --cpus 6 --name [EXP_NAME] --model-name GCNN --log-dir logs --epochs 1
  #+end_src
** Evaluation
  The trained models can be evaluated using:
  #+begin_src
    python evaluate.py --checkpoint weights/vrp/GraphSAGE/A-32-k5_GraphSAGE --arch GraphSAGE --results-path . --time-limit 60 --dataset datasets/vrp/A/M-n151-k12.vrp --problem CVRP
  #+end_src

  Additionally, there is a src_sh[:exports code]{--live} for both problems which plots the
  process of solving both the relaxed problem and printing the feasible solutions.


  A small /warning/ when using that option for BPP; the plotting uses
  multi-threading, and spawns a number of threads equal to the number of
  available bins, while this may be improved, at the time, we were only
  evaluating simple problems where number of bins ranged from 30-60.

  Also, one might notice that the transparent blue boxes sometimes, if not
  always, break free from the bin borders (in BPP), these are not coding
  glitches, in fact, they properly represent the relaxed problem, during which
  the constraints to the original problem (the boxes in other colors) are
  relaxed, i.e., allowed to be violated. The same concept applies to the
  background blue lines in the VRP visualization.

  #+begin_src
    python evaluate.py --checkpoint weights/vrp/GraphSAGE/A-32-k5_GraphSAGE --arch GraphSAGE --results-path . --time-limit 60 --dataset datasets/vrp/A/M-n151-k12.vrp --problem CVRP --live
  #+end_src

*** Pre-trained Models
  The trained models weights are available under [[./weights]].
  For example, one can load the src_sh[:exports_code]{GraphSAGE} architecture
  weights when trained on src_sh[:exports_code]{A-n32-k5} as follows:
  #+begin_src
    python evaluate.py --checkpoint weights/[PROBLEM]/A-n32-k5_GraphSAGE
  #+end_src

  where PROBLEM ${\tiny \in}$ {CVRP, BPP}.
